Android Wear: Who's Next
This is an example application that explores the Google Wear API. The core
part of the application explores what's required to create custom clockfaces
on the Moto360. The example uses an Android Mobile application to consume 
data from a Google Compute Engine hosted Node.js server. The Mobile application
opens a data pipeline (using Android Wear) to push updates over Bluetooth to 
the watch. An HTML5 application is used to present the information and 
demonstrate the examples.
